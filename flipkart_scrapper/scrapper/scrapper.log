Build quality and design is very good. The case is in matte finish. Sound quality is very good, crystal clear in this price segment but the bass is decent enough not that great. For gamers this is not for you. You can play normal games not for professional use. Call mic is also good...I'm very impressed with the battery backup..Bluetooth connectivity is good...you can buy it without any doubt..."}, {'Product': 'noisebudsvs102', 'Name': 'Krishnan Mundakkal', 'Rating': '4', 'CommentHead': 'Pretty good', 'Comment': 'Loved the product. The design is really comfortable in my ear compared to others as i have to return them due to the ear pain but this one is so comfortable in my ears.Loved the colour so much i usually use classic black or white. First time trying a coloured one fell in love with it exact colour as shown.The only problem i felt was at the high volume the Volume distorts a little. This is only at the highest volume. But very good for money.'}, {'Product': 'noisebudsvs102', 'Name': 'Ashwani Shukla', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Terrific', 'Comment': 'Sound quality good and bass always good and design üëå super and battery backup so good but charging time very long'}, {'Product': 'noisebudsvs102', 'Name': 'Pragalbh Shukla', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Terrific', 'Comment': 'Best buds very nice sound and bass, high sensitive touch control..
